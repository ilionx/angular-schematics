# App Center Build Config

This schematic will add the App Center build configuration to build your Ionic + Capacitor app with Microsoft App Center.
It will add the necessary App Center postclone scripts to your native apps.

## How to use

```bash
# This will determine the appId from your Capacitor app configuration file
ng add @ilionx/app-center-build-config
# or provide the appId explicitly
ng add @ilionx/app-center-build-config com.ilionx.dummy
```
